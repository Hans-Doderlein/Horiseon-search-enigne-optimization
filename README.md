## Description

The main purpose of this project is to create a webiste that diplays information and benefits of search engine accesibility.

I created this web app as a compilation of information on this topic.

By creating this webiste I can inform visitors about search engine optimization.

So far, this webpage contains:

three links in the navbar to the different information sections located further down the page

3 informational sections

A side section listing the benefits of search engine optimization
