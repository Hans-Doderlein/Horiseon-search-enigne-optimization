# Horiseon search enigine optimization

## Description

The main purpose of this project is to create a webiste that optimizes search engine accesibility.

I created this web app as practice for using the coding languages and skills I've learned thus far.

By creating this webiste I can practice using HTMl and CSS concepts for future projects.

So far, this webpage contains:

three links in the navbar to the different information sections located further down the page

3 informational sections

A side section listing the benefits of search engine optimization
